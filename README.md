# JQuery Mini Project - Call To Action Button

Call to action buttons are very common on many professional websites, they are always used in web design for the purpose of marketing. This design is used to improve conversion rates when trying to rank in SEO.

In this project I thought of trying to make call to action buttons using jQuery and fixed position values in css3. In my mini portfolio I've done something similar with the back to top button, instead of a back to top button I could try do the same thing but make the buttons seen at the top.
